postgresql-10 (10~~devel-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New major upstream version 10; packaging based on postgresql-9.6.
  * Merge postgresql-contrib-10 package into postgresql-10. The added
    packaging complexity doesn't seem worth the split anymore given the extra
    dependencies are typically very small on average systems, or already
    installed anyway (libuuid, libxslt).
