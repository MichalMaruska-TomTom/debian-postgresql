    + Disallow substituting a schema or owner name into an extension script if
      the name contains a quote, backslash, or dollar sign (Noah Misch)

      This restriction guards against SQL-injection hazards for trusted
      extensions.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Micah Gate, Valerie Woolard, Tim
      Carey-Smith, and Christoph Berg for reporting this problem.
      (CVE-2023-39417)

    + Fix MERGE to enforce row security policies properly (Dean Rasheed)

      When MERGE performs an UPDATE action, it should enforce any UPDATE or
      SELECT RLS policies defined on the target table, to be consistent with
      the way that a plain UPDATE with a WHERE clause works.  Instead it was
      enforcing INSERT RLS policies for both INSERT and UPDATE actions.

      In addition, when MERGE performs a DO NOTHING action, it applied the
      target table's DELETE RLS policies to existing rows, even though those
      rows are not being deleted.  While it's not a security problem, this
      could result in unwanted errors.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Dean Rasheed for reporting this problem.

  * New upstream version.

    + Prevent CREATE SCHEMA from defeating changes in search_path
      (Report and fix by Alexander Lakhin, CVE-2023-2454)

      Within a CREATE SCHEMA command, objects in the prevailing search_path,
      as well as those in the newly-created schema, would be visible even
      within a called function or script that attempted to set a secure
      search_path.  This could allow any user having permission to create a
      schema to hijack the privileges of a security definer function or
      extension script.

    + Enforce row-level security policies correctly after inlining a
      set-returning function (Report by Wolfgang Walther, CVE-2023-2455)

      If a set-returning SQL-language function refers to a table having
      row-level security policies, and it can be inlined into a calling query,
      those RLS policies would not get enforced properly in some cases
      involving re-using a cached plan under a different role. This could
      allow a user to see or modify rows that should have been invisible.

    + libpq can leak memory contents after GSSAPI transport encryption
      initiation fails (Jacob Champion)

      A modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can send a
      not-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI (Kerberos)
      transport encryption.  libpq will then copy that string, as well as
      following bytes in application memory up to the next zero byte, to its
      error report. Depending on what the calling application does with the
      error report, this could result in disclosure of application memory
      contents.  There is also a small probability of a crash due to reading
      beyond the end of memory.  Fix by properly zero-terminating the server
      message. (CVE-2022-41862)
